Air Quality Index Prediction

Problem Statement
Predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for specific regions using environmental datasets. This project includes visualizations of pollution trends and provides health recommendations based on predicted AQI levels.

Data Collection
The datasets for this project were collected from the following sources:

[AQI Dashboard for India](https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/)
[Real-Time Air Quality Index Data from Data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/resource/real-time-air-quality-index-various-locations)
[Mendeley Data Repository](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/43sfz58vn7/1)

The data was collected using web scraping techniques from the sources mentioned above. After initial collection, multiple files were combined and preprocessed to create a unified dataset suitable for analysis and machine learning tasks.
